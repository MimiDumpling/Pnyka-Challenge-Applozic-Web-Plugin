# Pnyka Development Challenge

## Overview         

Thank you for your interest in joining the Pnyka engineering team! 

At Pnyka, we first and foremost are looking for intellectually curious people who can relate to and understand several different viewpoints. That’s not enough by itself, however. Everyone at Pnyka Engineering is expected to USE those viewpoints to make educated decisions about how to plan, implement, and test technical solutions. 

You may be thinking “this sounds obvious”… and given our mission it is to an extent. The problem is that it’s way easier to consider multiple viewpoints than it is to actually use them in a productive manner. What happens when two viewpoints are at odds with each other? What happens when you don’t have access to views different from your own? What if the viewpoints you’re considering are too vague or high-level for practical use? What is the best method to utilize several viewpoints to make a single decision? And how do you recognize when your own biases may be clouding your decision making?

With that in mind, we have assembled a technical challenge for interested candidates that not only encompasses our mission and values, but gives candidates a glimpse into the type of challenges that they can expect to encounter on the job. This includes elements of agile process, putting clearly defined plans in place to guide implementation, implementation itself, and overall communication.

This challenge is multi-faceted, ambiguous, demanding, open-ended and focused on practical coding. There is no right or wrong answer and is meant only to give you an opportunity to showcase your technical abilities.
## Instructions

Due to the open-ended nature of this challenge, we ask that you spend no more than five hours on it. It is perfectly acceptable to include “TODOs” in your submission.

You have been given two resources to complete this challenge. First, you have this code base with a barebones chat implementation using App-Lozic BaaS. This gives you a working demo web application that has basic chat functionality and UI. Second, you have a set of user feedback that has been collected during testing sessions that involved 6 person discussions about important societal issues. This gives you an idea of what our users will be looking for as we customize a chat experience for them. User feedback can be found in this file: “Pnyka - User Feedback Summary and Trends.pdf”.

### Deliverables
Using these resources (and any others you deem necessary) complete the following tasks:

1. Understand the user feedback and pick out a few features you believe would improve their experience most. Then, pick the top 3 and for each:
    1. Write a user story to capture what the feature is
    2. Explain why you chose this as a top 3 choice
    3. Estimate how long it would take to implement the feature (break this down as best you can)
    4. Devise acceptance criteria for the feature
    5. Put all of this into a text file called FEATURE_LIST at the top level of the project
2. Choose one (or more) feature(s) to implement yourself by iterating on the ‘full view’ barebones chat application codebase (look at /src/sample/fullview.html). This includes:
    1. A GitHub pull request (https://github.com/pnyka/Applozic-Web-Plugin) that includes any and all information that another engineer would need to review your code. E.g. the problem, your solution, documentation/resources used, tests and validation, open questions, TODOs, etc.
    2. For any feature that requires changes to data model, you may mock data as long as you describe the changes required in the data and/or APIs
    3. A short video screen capture of the feature working as intended
    4. Assign the pull request to greysongregory (https://github.com/greysongregory)
3. Create a short bulleted list of tools, tricks, libraries and references used - what does your development environment consist of?
    1. Put this in a text file called DEV_ENV at the top level of the project
4. Keep notes on things you’ve learned during this process
    1. Put this in a text file called LEARNINGS
5. [Optional] As you begin running and understanding the code, record bugs as you find them including:
    1. Steps to reproduce
    2. Impact the bug has on the user/business/engineers
    3. A potential solution
    4. Put this in a text file called BUGS at the top level of the project
6. [Optional] Provide instructions on how you would deploy this web app for use on the world wide web. This can anything between be high level thoughts and detailed step-by-step instructions
    1. Put this in a text file called DEPLOYMENT at the top level of the project
    
## What we're looking for
1. How you reason through technical problems.
2. How you read code and understand it.
3. How you write code and test it.
4. How you use tools and libraries to make your life easier
5. How you communicate as you do the above.

### Tips
1. Show your work and make sure to put a spotlight on what you’re most proud of.
2. Showcase your strengths.
3. Approach this as a learning opportunity.
4. Take notes (ideally annotating code) as you learn/understand.
5. DO NOT spend lots of time figuring out how to fix small issues that block progress, instead make a note of them and explain how you might go about learning how to fix it.
6. Be sure to provide reasoning for decisions, but especially for ones where you had to make a tough choice.

## Submission Checklist
1. Pull request with your code and text files
2. FEATURE_LIST text file
3. DEV_ENV text file
4. LEARNINGS text file
5. [Optional] BUGS text file
6. [Optional] DEPLOYMENT text file
7. [Optional] NOTES text file - for anything else you'd like us to consider
